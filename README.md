This project is designed as a unified platform that empowers creators, performers, readers, and authorisers to easily create, book, publish, and manage their digital or interactive content. The goal is to provide a simple, flexible environment where each user role can accomplish their tasks smoothly while contributing to a shared creative ecosystem.

🚧 Current Focus: Building the Explore Editor

Our first development milestone is the creation of the Explore Editor, a central feature that allows all user types—especially creators—to:

Draft new content
Edit existing materials
Insert components and graphical elements
Preview publications
Manage versioning and revisions

This editor forms the foundation for all future features, including publishing, booking, reviewing, and collaborative workflows.
